Work Mode Chrome Extension
==========================
This extension turns tabs content to B&W and removes images where possible. It does not remove video, canvas and flash.

Extension remembers tabs where it was enabled and all tabs opened from enabled tabs get enabled automatically.

Installation
------------
I don't want to pay 5$ for developer account just for this extension because for it works for me anyway.

To install it copy folder WorkMode to any suitable location, set Chrome Extension Developer mode and add copied folder.
